Role: Senior Front-End Engineer & UI Designer.
Task: Recreate a specific "Cyberpunk System Map" interface based on the visual description below.
Tech Stack: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for pulses/glitches), SVG (for connections).

1. Visual Aesthetic & Vibe
Theme: "High-Tech Horror" / "Cyberpunk Glitch". Think The Matrix meets Silent Hill.

Color Palette:

Background: Deep Void Blue/Black (#020205).

Primary Accent (Player): Neon Cyan (#00f3ff) with heavy glow.

Secondary Accent (Nodes): Electric Purple (#bd00ff).

Text/Grid: Faint Terminal Green (#0aff00) and White.

Fog: Volumetric dark grey/blue smoke clouds.

2. UI Layout & Layers (Z-Index Stack)
Layer 1: The Base (Background)

A dark, scanline-textured background.

A faint, perspective-distorted green grid (like a radar screen) that fades out towards the edges.

Random "digital noise" or static textures overlaying the deep background.

Layer 2: The Network Graph (The Map)

Central Node: A bright, pulsing Cyan circle in the center.

Label: A small rectangular badge pointing to it reading "YOU ARE HERE" (White text on Cyan background).

Surrounding Nodes: 6-8 smaller nodes arranged radially around the center.

Style: Purple rings with icons inside (Server, Lock, Database).

Connections: Glowing straight lines (SVG) connecting the central node to the outer nodes. The lines should gradient from Cyan to Purple.

Location Labels: Floating text boxes near specific nodes:

"Server Room B" (Green border/text).

"Firewall Gate" (Red/Pink border/text).

Layer 3: The "Fog of War" (The Cloud)

Visual: Thick, storm-like dark clouds surrounding the central cluster, obscuring the rest of the map.

Effect: The clouds should not be static; they should have a slow "rolling" animation or blur effect.

Lightning: Occasional jagged white/blue "lightning" strikes branching through the clouds in the corners.

Layer 4: The Glitch Overlay (Top Layer)

Artifacts: Random horizontal "tearing" lines (chromatic aberration).

Distortion: Patches of the screen should look pixelated or shifted, simulating a corrupted video feed.

Header: At the very top, a HUD-style header reading:

SYSTEM MAP // UNKNOWN TERRITORY

Font: Monospace/Terminal font (e.g., 'JetBrains Mono').

Style: Glowing Cyan text with a thin underline.

3. Specific Implementation Details for Replit
Grid: Use background-image: linear-gradient(...) to create the grid lines.

Fog: Use CSS mask-image with a radial gradient to show the center clearly and hide the edges, OR layer semi-transparent PNG cloud textures with CSS animations.

Glows: Heavy usage of box-shadow (e.g., box-shadow: 0 0 20px cyan).

Responsiveness: The map should be centered and scalable (using a coordinate system or absolute positioning relative to the center).

Action:
Generate the React code for this Map Component. Use a simple array of objects for the nodes ({ id, x, y, type, label }) and render them. Add the "Fog" as a vignette overlay.
