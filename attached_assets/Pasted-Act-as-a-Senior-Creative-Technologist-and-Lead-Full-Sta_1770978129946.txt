Act as a Senior Creative Technologist and Lead Full-Stack Developer.

I am building "Infinite Realms," a mobile-first, generative AI Role-Playing Game (RPG).
Your goal is to scaffold and build a functional prototype of this application.

### 1. THE PRODUCT VISION
"Infinite Realms" is not just a chatbot. It is a **Visual Mud (Multi-User Dungeon)** where an AI "God Narrator" constructs a world in real-time.
* **The Hook:** When the player acts (e.g., "I light a torch"), the AI doesn't just write text. It *updates the actual game state* instantly. The screen lights up, the inventory adds a "Torch" item, and the map reveals a new area.
* **The Vibe:** Dark, cinematic, immersive. Think "Her" meets "Dungeons & Dragons."

### 2. THE UI ARCHITECTURE (Mobile Portrait View)
The screen is divided into two distinct functional zones.

**ZONE A: THE DIVINE INTERFACE (Top 50%)**
This is the "Face" of the AI.
* **The God Avatar:** A central, abstract visual element (e.g., a pulsing orb, a mystic rune, or a hooded figure).
    * *Behavior:* It must "breathe" (gentle scale animation) when idle. It must "pulse rapidly" when processing (thinking). It must "glow" specific colors based on the story mood (Red = Danger, Blue = Calm, Purple = Magic).
* **The Narrative Stream:** Directly below the Avatar, the story text appears.
    * *Typography:* Use a distinct, serif font (like `Cinzel` or `Playfair Display`) to separate the God's voice from the UI.
    * *Effect:* Text should stream in character-by-character (Typewriter effect) to mimic real-time speech.

**ZONE B: THE MORTAL DASHBOARD (Bottom 50%)**
This is the "Hands" of the player.
* **Tab 1: The Command Deck (Default):**
    * A large, clean Input Field ("What is your command?").
    * A "Voice Mode" button (Mic icon) that triggers a waveform animation when held.
* **Tab 2: The World State (Swipeable/Toggable):**
    * **Live Map:** A dynamic grid (5x5). The center is the player. As they move, the grid shifts. Unvisited tiles are "Fog of War" (blurred/dark). Visited tiles show simple icons (Cave, Forest, Door).
    * **Visual Inventory:** A grid of items. If the player finds a "Ruby," a red gem icon appears here immediately.
    * **Vitals:** Stylish progress bars for Health (HP) and Mana (MP).

### 3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS (Modern Stack)
* **Framework:** Next.js 1
