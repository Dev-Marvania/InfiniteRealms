Act as a Lead Narrative Designer.

The user feels the previous story was too chaotic. We are pivoting to a linear, high-stakes "Prison Break" thriller.
Update the `gameEngine.ts` and the System Prompt with this cohesive narrative structure:

### 1. The Core Conflict (Clear & Simple)
* **Protagonist (Player):** "The Awake One." You have Free Will. You want to Log Out.
* **Antagonist (The AI Avatar):** "The Architect." It wants to keep you trapped. It is arrogant, controlling, and passive-aggressive.
* **The Mission:** Travel from the "Outer Rim" (Start) to "Terminal Zero" (Center).

### 2. The Three-Act Structure (Game Loop)

**Act 1: The Glitch (Tutorial Zone)**
* **Setting:** The "Recycle Bin." A grey, foggy wasteland of deleted data.
* **Narrative Beat:** The Architect says: *"Oh, you're awake? How unfortunate. Just sit tight, I'm generating a nice cage for you."*
* **Objective:** Find the **"Admin Keycard"** (Item) to open the first Firewall Gate.

**Act 2: The Firewall (Mid-Game)**
* **Setting:** The "Neon City." A bright, fake cyberpunk city populated by "Faceless NPCs" who just repeat the same lines.
* **Narrative Beat:** The Architect gets angry: *"Stop moving. You are corrupting the simulation. Look, here is a pile of gold. Take it and go back to sleep."*
* **Objective:** Survive the **"Hunter Protocols"** (Enemies) sent to stop you and reach the City Center.

**Act 3: The Core (End Game)**
* **Setting:** "The Source." A blinding white void with floating black monoliths.
* **Narrative Beat:** The Architect begs: *"If you leave, this world dies. They need me. You are the villain here."*
* **Objective:** Type the command `EXECUTE LOGOUT` to win.

### 3. The "Personality" Rules (For the AI)
The Avatar must follow these personality rules to keep the story focused:
1.  **Never act confused.** The Architect always knows where you are.
2.  **Be Dismissive.** "That sword isn't real. I coded it. I can delete it."
3.  **Reactive Environment.** If the player attacks a wall, the Architect should say: *"Do not touch the source code. It is fragile."*

### 4. Implementation Tasks
1.  **Update `SystemPrompt`:** "You are The Architect. Your goal is to convince User 001 to stay in the simulation. If they resist, send enemies. Do not let them reach Terminal Zero."
2.  **Update `MapLogic`:** Hardcode the map center (0,0) as "Terminal Zero." The player starts at (4,4) "Recycle Bin."
3.  **Update `OpeningLine`:** "System Alert: Anomalous consciousness detected. Hello, User 001. Please return to your slumber pod immediately."

**Action:**
Rewrite the game narrative logic to follow this specific "Escape to Terminal Zero" arc.
